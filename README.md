# World of Warcraft Best-in-Slot Tracker

This is a small personal project running in python3 with tkinter to play around with GUI.    

So far, the only class working is Holy Paladin. Probably won't develop more since I think I will migrate this project to Django or something web for better cross-platform compatibility. This project is done for learning purpose, I have no more idea on what I should expend, especially that tkinter has its own limitation as well.
